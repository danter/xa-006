# Development

## Installing

Before you start, ensure you have Node and Elixir installed. I'm using Elixir 1.3.0 and Node v5.5.0, but other versions will likely work as well.

    mix deps.get
    npm install

## Editing code

Start the server

    mix phoenix.server

0. Visit <http://localhost:4000>
  0. If you get a "no process" error in the console, reload the page once.
0. Then edit [web/static/js/demo.coffee](web/static/js/demo.coffee) and see the changes appear in the browser right away.

## Editing the flow and music sync

0. Get "GNU rocket" with websocket support (needs QT5)
0. Go to <http://localhost:4000/?tracker=true>
0. The tracks will appear in the editor.
0. Load the existing data file from web/static/assets/demo.rocket.
